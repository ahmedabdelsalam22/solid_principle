A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.


# What Problem these S.O.L.I.D principles solved?


- working with the legacy code.

- Re-reading the code multiple times to get to the part you need to change

- Hard to understand what the method does. jumping multiple methods of the same name

- spending a lot more time to fix a minor bug

# Single Responsibility

- A class should have a single responsibility


# Open-Closed

- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification


# Liskov Substitution

- If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.


# Interface Segregation

- Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.

# Dependency Inversion

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction.

- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
